# CommonsenseQA_RN
A repo for my code on Hybrid RN for CommonsenseQA

In utils whichever type of adjacency matrix for schema graphs you want just rename that file to graph.py and then run 

Requirements:

Use these commands to install the requirements:

pip install torch-scatter==latest+cu101 -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.6.0.html

pip install torch-sparse==latest+cu101 -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.6.0.html

pip install torch-cluster==latest+cu101 -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.6.0.html

pip install torch-spline-conv==latest+cu101 -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.6.0.html

pip install torch-geometric

pip install torch==1.6.0+cu101 torchvision==0.7.0+cu101 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

TO RUN VANILLA GN

Ensure you have the correct grounding files stores with you

python newprocess_1.py

python gn.py --encoder bert-base-uncased -mbs 4 -dlr 1e-3


TO RUN HYBRID_GN:

Ensure you have the intermediate json files generated by the generator for the non-adj-cp-pairs only and also the generated evidences. The path to generated evidence are dev_gen_evidence_path and train_gen_evidence_path. 

Also ensure you have the data folder ready with the cpnet_vocab_path and train and test adjacency files as in the MHGRN repo

python create_adj_data_1.py dev_intermediate_json_path train_intermediate_json_path dev_gen_evidence_path train_gen_evidence_path

python gn_hybrid.py --encoder bert-base-uncased -mbs 4 -dlr 1e-3 --train_evi train_gen_evidence_path --dev_evi dev_gen_evidence_path
